This is essentially a notepad and Pytorch reference for myself as I continue my Machine Learning studies. So it's filled with comments, annotations, etc... it's not clean at all and it never will be. There are no standards here, just learning. I couldn't use the HF Trainer API forever now could I?

If you want to see my raw notes and a crummy BoW model trained using a very non-robust-loop on a very-common dataset, this is your repo. It's public so I can prove that I know Pytorch in a pinch.
